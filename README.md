# Scrim-organiser
This project aims to make it easier for university teams within the UK to organise scrims between themselves. 

The current plan is to make the captains of the teams fill in a Google form with their details and also the times in the week that they are free. Using the csv file from the Google form the program will find teams that are free at the same times. The captains will then be emailed with the details of the teams that they can scrim with.
